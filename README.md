# SET Lab â€“ Basic Social Engineering

## Overview
In this lab, I used the **Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)** to test basic social engineering attacks in a safe lab setup. The goal was to understand how attackers can create fake login pages to trick users and collect credentials.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit)
- Localhost (for hosting the cloned site)

---

## What I Did
- Launched SET and explored the different attack options
- Used the **Website Attack Vector** and selected the **Credential Harvester** method
- Cloned a real website (like a login page)
- Hosted it on my local machine
- Captured fake credentials to see how it works

## How to Run
sudo setoolkit
# Choose: 1) Social-Engineering Attacks
# Then: 2) Website Attack Vectors
# Then: 3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
# Then: 2) Site Cloner
# Enter any login URL to clone (like https://example.com)
